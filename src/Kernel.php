// Bootstrapping: The Kernel class initializes the Symfony application by bootstrapping necessary components and configurations. It sets up the auto loading mechanism, registers bundles, and prepares the environment for request handling.
// Request Handling: The Kernel class receives incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to the appropriate controller for processing. It coordinates the execution of various components, including routing, controllers, and event listeners, to generate a response.
// Service Container: Symfony relies heavily on its dependency injection container, known as the service container. The Kernel class provides the initial configuration for the service container, including registering services, setting parameters, and managing service configurations.
// Environment Configuration: The Kernel class allows you to define different configurations based on the application's environment. By specifying environment-specific settings such as database connections, logging, and caching, you can tailor the behavior of your Symfony application for development, staging, and production environments.
// Bundle Registration: Symfony follows a modular architecture, and the Kernel class is responsible for registering bundles in your application. Bundles encapsulate reusable functionality and can be added or removed based on your project's requirements. The registerBundles() method in the Kernel class allows you to enable or disable bundles.
// Event Handling: Symfony employs an event-driven architecture, and the Kernel class plays a role in event handling. It defines and dispatches core events, allowing you to modify the behavior of the application at various stages of the request lifecycle.
// The Kernel class serves as a central point for managing and coordinating various components of a Symfony application. It acts as the bridge between the HTTP layer, service container, routing, and event system, providing a foundation for building robust and extensible web applications.
